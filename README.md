# DevBytes-Player

DevByte Player is a simple app I developed following the [Android App Development in Kotlin course on Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud9012).The app showcases using [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) and a Repository to create an offline cache. It also covers how to use [WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager) for scheduling periodic work. In this app it's used to setup a daily background data sync.
